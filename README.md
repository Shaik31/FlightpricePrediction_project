# FlightpricePrediction_project

In this project, I developed a flight price prediction model using the XGBoost regressor to estimate flight ticket prices based on various features such as departure time, duration, and airlines. The XGBoost algorithm, known for its high performance and accuracy, was used to build the predictive model. By analyzing historical flight data, the model was able to predict prices with a high degree of precision. This project showcased the application of gradient boosting techniques in pricing strategies and can be valuable for travel agencies and booking platforms in optimizing pricing strategies.
